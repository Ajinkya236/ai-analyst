## Algorithms and Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Landing Page Structure
1. Create main landing page component with sections:
   - Hero section (headline, subheadline, visual, single CTA)
   - Benefits section (scannable format with icons)
   - Social proof section (testimonials + logos)
   - FAQ section (collapsible cards)
   - Final CTA section (single bold CTA)

### Step 2: Hero Section Implementation
1. Display compelling headline and subheadline
2. Include supporting visual (placeholder or animated element)
3. Single "Analyze Startups" CTA button
4. No secondary CTAs in hero section
5. Fast loading (<2s) with optimized assets

### Step 3: Benefits Section
1. Present features as benefits-driven headlines with icons
2. Map each feature to business value (e.g., "Automated memo drafting → Saves associates 70% manual effort")
3. Use scannable format (bullet points, <50 words per benefit)
4. Include relevant icons for each benefit

### Step 4: Social Proof Section
1. Rotate authentic testimonials with names, photos, affiliations
2. Display VC firm or accelerator logos (placeholder for now)
3. Ensure at least one testimonial + logo block before FAQ
4. Use carousel or grid layout for testimonials

### Step 5: FAQ Section
1. Create collapsible FAQ cards for clean UX
2. Address typical objections (privacy, data accuracy, human control)
3. Reinforce humans-in-control narrative
4. Use smooth expand/collapse animations

### Step 6: Final CTA Section
1. Display single "Analyze Startups" CTA with action color
2. Remove navigation/footer clutter near CTA
3. Ensure only one CTA visible in bottom section
4. Match hero CTA styling for consistency

### Step 7: Navigation Logic
1. Detect new vs returning visitors (localStorage/cookies)
2. Personalize messaging for returning users
3. Redirect "Analyze Startups" clicks to My Reports page
4. Auto-create default workspace for first-time users
5. Seamless redirect with no intermediate popups or delays >1s

### Step 8: Responsive Design
1. Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
2. Ensure all sections work on mobile, tablet, desktop
3. Optimize CTA buttons for mobile tap targets (≥44px)
4. Test across different screen sizes
