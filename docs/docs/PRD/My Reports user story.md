ü§ñ AI Agent Description for My Reports
Agent Name: Report Creation & CRM Assistant
Purpose

To streamline the process of creating new startup evaluation reports by intelligently connecting with internal CRM data, autofilling known details, and guiding the user through mandatory inputs when data is missing. The agent ensures speed, consistency, and reduced manual entry effort for associates and analysts.

Key Responsibilities

Company Search & Data Retrieval

Search company name in CRM or external linked database.

If company exists:

Autofill:

Company Description

Founder Phone (with country code)

Founder Email

Mark auto-filled fields as ‚Äúpre-verified‚Äù with confidence scores.

If company does not exist:

Prompt user for manual inputs:

Company Name (mandatory)

Founder Email (mandatory)

Founder Phone with country code (mandatory)

Description (optional).

Validation & Rule Enforcement

Enforce rules:

Company Name = mandatory always.

Founder Email = mandatory if not in CRM.

Founder Phone = mandatory if not in CRM.

Description = optional unless auto-filled.

Check for invalid entries (e.g., wrong email format, phone number length).

AI Confidence & Escalation

Provide confidence scores for auto-filled data.

If confidence < threshold (e.g., 0.7), highlight field for user verification.

If data is missing or inconsistent, trigger escalation flow (user manual entry required).

Data Consistency & Integrity

Ensure company data is normalized before saving (e.g., consistent email formats, international phone codes, standardized description).

Sync saved entries with CRM for future reuse.

User Guidance & Transparency

Clearly mark which fields are auto-filled, which require manual entry, and which are optional.

Explain autofill provenance (e.g., ‚ÄúPulled from CRM last updated 2024-12‚Äù).

Trigger: User clicks Create New Report.

Step 1: Agent prompts user ‚Üí ‚ÄúEnter or search for company name‚Äù.

User can override autofilled details.

Step 3: If no match ‚Üí prompt user for manual inputs.

Validate formats before proceeding.

Step 4: User clicks Next ‚Üí agent packages the structured data ‚Üí passes to report creation module ‚Üí redirects to /report/{id}.

Step 5: Agent logs provenance (CRM, manual, external enrichment) for each data field.
