  - Upload video or audio files
  - Add YouTube link
  - Add website link
  - Paste text (with large limit)

#### 4.2.1 Dynamic Input Process

- **Step 2**: Same popup dynamically updates to ask for relevant input:
  - File upload for documents/video/audio
  - URL input for YouTube/website links
  - Text input for paste text option
- **Step 3**: "Add Source" button saves the source

### 4.4 Deep Search Button
‚Ä¢	- **Trigger**: When user clicks Deep Search button
Input: Startup name already filled, sector, geography, stage, key questions in a pop up, and then enter
‚Ä¢	Human Role: Analyst specifies what needs to be researched (e.g., "Check competitors, funding history, regulatory risks").
AI Role: Translate objective into structured search queries across reliable domains.
 
üîπ Step 2: Smart Search & Data Sourcing
The agent should run multi-layered searches:
1.	Official & Primary Sources:
o	Startup website, Crunchbase, PitchBook, AngelList, company registry.
2.	Financial & Funding Data:
o	SEC filings, Tracxn, CB Insights, press releases.
3.	Market & Competitor Intelligence:
o	Gartner, Statista, industry reports, Google Scholar.
4.	Sentiment & Social Signals:
o	LinkedIn, Twitter, Glassdoor (for employee satisfaction), TrustPilot (for customer reviews).
5.	Regulatory / Compliance:
o	Government registries, legal filings, patents (USPTO, WIPO).
‚úÖ AI Role:
‚Ä¢	Run queries like "Startup Name" AND "funding round"
‚Ä¢	Cross-validate funding amounts across sources.
‚Ä¢	Scrape structured and unstructured data.
 
üîπ Step 3: Data Extraction & Structuring
‚Ä¢	Normalize data into JSON/Tabular format.
‚Ä¢	Key Fields:
o	Company Info: Name, website, HQ, founding year.
o	Founders: Names, LinkedIn, experience, previous exits.
o	Funding: Rounds, investors, amounts, dates.
o	Market: TAM, SAM, SOM estimates.
o	Competition: Direct, indirect, substitutes.
o	Metrics: Revenue, ARR, churn, CAC, LTV, runway.

üîπ Step 4: Enrichment & Benchmarking
‚Ä¢	Compare startup‚Äôs metrics against:
o	Industry averages (growth rates, CAC benchmarks).
o	Competitor positioning (funding vs. traction).
‚Ä¢	Use LLM summarization to create:
o	SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).
o	Red Flag Report (e.g., missing founder experience, litigation).
 
üîπ Step 5: Quality & Reliability Scoring
‚Ä¢	Each data point gets a confidence score based on source reliability.
‚Ä¢	Example:
o	SEC filing (95% reliable)
o	Tech blog rumor (40% reliable)
‚Ä¢	Aggregate into a Research Confidence Score.
 
üîπ Step 6: Output & Delivery
‚Ä¢	Output Format:
o	Dashboard view + structured report (JSON, Excel, PDF).
o	API integration for VC pipeline tools (Affinity, Salesforce).
‚Ä¢	Sample Output JSON:
{
  "startup": "Acme AI",
  "founders": [
    {"name": "Jane Doe", "linkedin": "url", "past_exits": 1}
  ],
  "funding": [
    {"round": "Series A", "amount": 15000000, "investors": ["Sequoia", "Accel"], "date": "2023-06-10"}

‚Ä¢	Associate: Validates raw findings, adds missing insights.
‚Ä¢	Principal: Reviews AI + associate summary for red flags.
‚Ä¢	Partner: Uses enriched, validated output for IC (Investment Committee) decision.

#### data ingestion agent
--- System will show a loading splash icon and please wait, no need to stick around , till the time our ingestion agent has used rag/cag/mcp for storing the sources data 
- once all sources data is  ingested , then only next button is active 
Title: Data Ingestion Agent for Source Data

As a VC analyst,
I want the system to automatically ingest all uploaded or collected sources using a data ingestion agent while showing a loading splash,
So that I can focus on other tasks and proceed to the next stage only after all source data is processed and stored reliably.

User Journey with Embedded Rules & Flows
Step 1: Trigger Data Ingestion

User clicks ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button after adding and selecting at least one source.

Activates Data Ingestion Agent to process all selected sources.

Displays loading splash icon with message: ‚ÄúPlease wait, data is being ingested‚Ä¶‚Äù

Rules:

Next stage button remains disabled until ingestion is complete.

User should not interact with the source list during ingestion.

Step 2: Ingestion Processing

Agent Behavior:

Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), CAG (Context-Aware Generation), MCP (Multi-Channel Processing) to ingest, normalize, and store data.

Supports multiple source types: documents (PDF, DOCX, PPT), videos, audio, URLs, large text.

Handles parallel ingestion for efficiency.

Tracks progress internally (number of sources ingested / total sources).

Rules:

If any source ingestion fails ‚Üí log failure with reason, continue with other sources.

Data must be structured for later use (JSON, tabular).

Confidence scoring applied per source for reliability tracking.

Step 3: Completion

Agent signals ingestion completion.

System Actions:

Hides loading splash.

Updates Next button ‚Üí active.

Optionally shows success notification with summary: total sources ingested, failed sources.

Rules:

Analyst cannot proceed until at least one source is successfully ingested.

Failed sources can be retried manually.

Agent Description

Automatically process and store all selected sources for a startup report, ensuring data is normalized, structured, and ready for downstream AI analysis.

Capabilities:

Parallel ingestion of multiple source types.

Uses RAG, CAG, MCP for intelligent parsing and context-aware storage.

Tracks ingestion progress and handles failures gracefully.

Generates structured output suitable for AI analysis and reporting.

Boundaries:

Does not modify original source content.

Does not trigger next stage until ingestion is complete.

Handles only selected sources in current session.

Acceptance Criteria (AC) in GWT

Trigger Ingestion

Given at least one source is added and selected

When user clicks Next

Then data ingestion agent starts processing and loading splash is shown, and Next button remains inactive.

Parallel Processing

Given multiple sources exist

When ingestion starts

Then agent processes sources in parallel and tracks progress internally.

Failure Handling

Given a source ingestion fails

When ingestion continues

Then failure reason is logged, other sources continue processing.

Completion & Next Button Activation

Given all sources are successfully ingested

When ingestion completes

Then system hides loading splash and activates the Next button.

Status Feedback

Given ingestion is in progress

When user checks system

Then loading splash and ‚ÄúPlease wait‚Äù message are visible until completion.

Data Structuring

Given sources are ingested

When ingestion finishes

Then all data is stored in structured format (JSON, tabular) for downstream analysis.
